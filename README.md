## accessible projects

- [X.init](https://xinit.herokuapp.com) A Webapp dedicated to automating financial info processing with NLP and others
- [Market Making Simulation](https://github.com/Code-Omega/Trader-Evolution), [High Frequency Trading Simulation](https://github.com/Code-Omega/Agent-Based-Simulation-Finance-) Some market simulations; better for studying dynamics and policies than testing individual strategies; the basic framework can always be adapted.
- [Mulet](https://code-omega.github.io/Mulet/) An old personal creative archive that's out of maintenance

## other things i did and why you shouldn't access (don't have access to) them

- Soft-bodied robot; Movement not sophisticated enough & files not well organized
- VR for Brain-Computer-Interfacing; Sealed until I revisit the topic
- Neural Network stuff and other simulations; Actually interesting but not up to my standard
- Other Webapps and Data analytic/visualization projects; Enough of them
